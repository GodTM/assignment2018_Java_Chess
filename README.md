The final version of the project is in v6(commit message : GUI partially working). There are 3 types of players: Human Player, Computer player which makes random moves, and an Aggressive Computer Player( which tries to eliminate the opposition piece with the most points)(Greedy Approach). The command line version is functional whereas the GUI version is partially working.
